# Techniques to Better Understand What People Want & Build Resilience

## 1. Figuring Out What People Want (Customer Discovery & Empathy)

### A. Use the 3-Question Echo
Ask three consecutive questions to dig deeper into the customer’s goal or concern:
- “What brings you in today?”
- “Can you tell me more about that?”
- “What’s most important to you when making that decision?”

### B. Mirror + Label
- **Mirroring**: Repeat the last 1–3 words of their sentence in a curious tone.
- **Labeling**: Name the emotion you think they’re expressing.  
  _Example: “You’re feeling uncertain about your retirement plan.”_

### C. Identify Decision Signals
Pay attention to what kind of questions they ask:
- **Technical questions** → Analytical decision-maker
- **Stories or people references** → Emotional decision-maker  
Tailor your explanation style to match their decision style.

### D. Practice Recapping
Summarize their goals before suggesting solutions.  
_Example: “Just to make sure I’ve got this right—you’re looking for a low-risk way to grow your savings without locking up the funds long term?”_

## 2. Becoming More Resilient (Emotional Regulation & Recovery)

### A. Pause and Label Internal State
When stressed or drained:
- Pause
- Name the emotion you’re feeling (“I’m feeling overwhelmed”)  
This activates your prefrontal cortex and helps regulate your reaction.

### B. Use Reframing Questions
When things go wrong, ask yourself:
- “What is this situation here to teach me?”
- “What can I control right now?”
- “How would my best self respond?”

### C. Build Micro-Routines
Design short routines for transitions:
- **Post-interaction reset**: Deep breath, stretch, short walk
- **Pre-shift focus ritual**: Write down one goal for the day

### D. Ask for Feedback Strategically
Let others know what you're working on:  
_“I’m working on understanding people better and handling stress with more poise. Would you mind giving me feedback if you see something I can improve?”_
