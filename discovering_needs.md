# Frameworks for Understanding What People Want

Developing the skill to uncover, understand, and recognize what drives a person — whether it’s an immediate or deeper need — can be built using several frameworks:

---

## 1. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
*People seek to fulfill needs in layers, from basic survival to self-actualization.*

- **Physiological needs**: Food, shelter, rest
- **Safety needs**: Security, stability
- **Belongingness and love needs**: Relationships, community
- **Esteem needs**: Respect, achievement, status
- **Self-actualization**: Growth, purpose, self-fulfillment

**How to apply:**  
- Listen for clues about *what level* of need is being expressed.
- Sometimes an immediate ask hides a deeper need.

---

## 2. Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Theory
*People "hire" solutions to get specific jobs done in their life.*

- **Functional Jobs**: e.g., "I need to get to work faster."
- **Emotional Jobs**: e.g., "I need to feel in control of my mornings."
- **Social Jobs**: e.g., "I want others to see me as successful."

**How to apply:**  
- Ask: *What "job" is this person trying to accomplish?*
- Look beyond *what* they want to *why* they want it.

---

## 3. Five Whys Method
*Dig deeper by asking "why?" multiple times.*

Example:
> "I want to switch banks."
> - Why? "Their app is bad."
>   - Why? "It makes me feel frustrated."
>     - Why? "I expect quick access to my money."
>       - Why? "Financial control is important to me."
>         - Why? "I grew up in a household where money was tight."

**How to apply:**  
- Practice softly asking "why" or saying, "Can you tell me more about that?" to gently dig deeper.

## 4. Human Core Drives (Octalysis Framework)
*People act based on 8 core drives (Yu-kai Chou).*

- Meaning/Purpose
- Accomplishment
- Empowerment/Creativity
- Ownership/Possession
- Social Influence
- Scarcity/Impulsivity
- Unpredictability/Curiosity
- Avoidance/Loss

**How to apply:**  
- Spot which *drive* is motivating behavior.
- Example: Obsession with investments may be driven by *ownership* and *loss avoidance*.

---

## 5. Surface vs. Deep Needs Model
*What people say they want vs. what they actually need.*

- **Surface want**: A new car
- **Deeper need**: Confidence, freedom, status

**How to apply:**  
- Notice contradictions between speech and action.
- Assume there is always a deeper emotional driver.

---

## 6. Transactional Analysis (Parent-Adult-Child Ego States)
*Communication reveals a person’s emotional state.*

- **Parent**: Teaching, rules, authority
- **Adult**: Rational, fact-based
- **Child**: Emotional, playful, needy

**How to apply:**  
- Tune into *which mode* someone is speaking from.
- Example: A “child” voice may hint at hidden insecurity behind a rational request.

---

## 7. SPIN Selling Framework
*Conversations that guide someone from surface to deeper needs.*

- **Situation**: Facts (what’s happening now)
- **Problem**: Frustrations (what’s wrong?)
- **Implication**: Consequences (what happens if nothing changes?)
- **Need-Payoff**: Emotional benefit (how life will improve)

**How to apply:**  
- Guide conversations from facts → frustrations → consequences → emotional payoff.

# Techniques to Better Understand What People Want & Build Resilience

## 1. Figuring Out What People Want (Customer Discovery & Empathy)

### A. Use the 3-Question Echo
Ask three consecutive questions to dig deeper into the customer’s goal or concern:
- “What brings you in today?”
- “Can you tell me more about that?”
- “What’s most important to you when making that decision?”

### B. Mirror + Label
- **Mirroring**: Repeat the last 1–3 words of their sentence in a curious tone.
- **Labeling**: Name the emotion you think they’re expressing.  
  _Example: “You’re feeling uncertain about your retirement plan.”_

### C. Identify Decision Signals
Pay attention to what kind of questions they ask:
- **Technical questions** → Analytical decision-maker
- **Stories or people references** → Emotional decision-maker  
Tailor your explanation style to match their decision style.

### D. Practice Recapping
Summarize their goals before suggesting solutions.  
_Example: “Just to make sure I’ve got this right—you’re looking for a low-risk way to grow your savings without locking up the funds long term?”_

---

## 2. Becoming More Resilient (Emotional Regulation & Recovery)

### A. Pause and Label Internal State
When stressed or drained:
- Pause
- Name the emotion you’re feeling (“I’m feeling overwhelmed”)  
This activates your prefrontal cortex and helps regulate your reaction.

### B. Use Reframing Questions
When things go wrong, ask yourself:
- “What is this situation here to teach me?”
- “What can I control right now?”
- “How would my best self respond?”

### C. Build Micro-Routines
Design short routines for transitions:
- **Post-interaction reset**: Deep breath, stretch, short walk
- **Pre-shift focus ritual**: Write down one goal for the day

### D. Ask for Feedback Strategically
Let others know what you're working on:  
_“I’m working on understanding people better and handling stress with more poise. Would you mind giving me feedback if you see something I can improve?”_
