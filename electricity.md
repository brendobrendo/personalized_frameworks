## Helpful Terms to Keep Top of Mind

- **Voltage**: The electric potential difference between two points in a circuit, which drives the flow of current.
- **Amperage (Current)**: The flow of electric charge through a conductor, measured in amperes (amps).
- **Wattage**: The rate at which electrical energy is used or produced, measured in watts. It is the product of voltage and current.
- **Alternating Current (AC)**: An electric current that reverses direction periodically. The voltage level alternates between positive and negative.
- **Direct Current (DC)**: An electric current that flows in one direction only, maintaining a constant voltage.

## ⚡ Bicycle Analogy for Direct Current (DC)

| **Electrical Concept** | **Bicycle Analogy** | **Explanation** |
|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Voltage (V)** | **Gear selection** | The gear determines how much *force* is applied per pedal stroke. A higher gear means more force per turn — like higher voltage pushing harder on each electron. A lower gear is gentler, like lower voltage. |
| **Current (I)** | **Rate of rotation (revolutions) of the chain or wheels per second** | Current represents the *rate of flow* of charge. The faster the chain (or wheels) spins, the more “charge” passes per unit time. |
| **Resistance (R)** | **Slope or friction** | Going uphill or having sticky bearings resists motion, just like resistance opposes current flow. |
| **Power (P = V × I)** | **Speed or overall effort of the cyclist** | Combining a high gear (voltage) *and* fast spinning (current) results in greater total power output — the cyclist goes faster or exerts more effort. |

## Gaps in My Understanding

### What is a good analogy for understanding voltage and how it differs from water pressure in a fire hose?

- **Current Understanding**: Voltage is often compared to water pressure in a fire hose, but this analogy has limitations. Voltage can be thought of as the potential energy that causes charge to flow, whereas water pressure in a hose directly forces water out of the nozzle. A more accurate analogy might be comparing voltage to the "height" of a water tank, which creates the pressure that pushes water through the hose.

### How is electrical current able to get from the power plant to the house using AC?

- **Current Understanding**: I understand that in AC circuits, the direction of electron flow alternates back and forth. However, I'm unclear about how electrons can travel long distances from the power plant to my house using AC while remaining efficient. How does the controlled back-and-forth motion of electrons result in the transfer of power over long distances without excessive energy loss?

### How is data transferred over electrical currents (both AC and DC)?

- **Current Understanding**: I understand that electricity can carry signals, but how exactly is data transferred through both AC and DC circuits? Is it the modulation of the current's amplitude, frequency, or both that enables data transmission?

## History of Discovery of Electricity

- **Ancient Discoveries**: Early experiments with static electricity date back to ancient Greece. Thales of Miletus observed that rubbing amber with fur caused it to attract small objects.
- **1700s - 1800s**: Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment in 1752 helped establish the connection between lightning and electricity. In the late 18th century, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta made significant discoveries in bioelectricity and the battery, respectively.
- **Late 1800s**: Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla played major roles in the development of electrical systems, with Edison pioneering DC-based systems and Tesla advocating for AC systems.
- **Modern Electricity**: The widespread use of electricity in homes and industries became possible with the development of AC power grids in the early 20th century.

## Examples of Electricity Naturally Occurring in Nature

- **Lightning**: A natural discharge of static electricity in the atmosphere, often occurring during thunderstorms.
- **Electric Fish**: Some fish species, such as electric eels, generate electric fields to navigate, communicate, and hunt.
- **Electric Fields in the Earth**: The Earth itself has a natural electric field, which can influence weather patterns and atmospheric electricity.

This framework should serve as a useful reference to solidify my understanding of electricity and the phenomena that occur both naturally and artificially.
