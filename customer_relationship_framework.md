# Brendan’s Personal Banker Customer Relationship Framework

---

## Pillar One: Recognizing, Uncovering, and Understanding What Someone Wants

**Objective:**  
Discover both the *immediate* and *deeper* needs behind why the customer is in front of you today.

### Sub-Skills
- Listen actively to the customer's words *and* emotional tone.
- Use open-ended questions to draw out unstated needs.
- Interpret behaviors and statements using models like Maslow’s Hierarchy, Jobs-to-Be-Done, or the Five Whys.
- Identify the difference between surface requests ("I want to open a savings account") and deeper motivations ("I want to feel more secure about my future").
- **Build psychological safety early** by mirroring tone and using relaxed, non-judgmental body language.

### Key Questions to Ask
- “What’s most important to you about [topic]?”
- “Can you tell me more about what led you to think about this today?”

### Trust Builder Phrase
> “You don’t have to decide anything today—we’re just here to explore what’s possible.”

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Jumping to solutions before the customer feels heard.
- Ignoring signs of guardedness (crossed arms, one-word answers, eye aversion).

### Mindset Reminder
*Be a detective, not a salesperson. Follow their story, not your assumptions.*

## Pillar Two: Recognizing How Someone Could Benefit from the Products and Services You Offer (Even When They Don't Know It Yet)

**Objective:**  
Connect the customer’s deeper needs to meaningful, valuable solutions they may not even realize they need yet.

### Sub-Skills
- Translate needs into solutions, even when customers don’t explicitly ask.
- Think in categories: protection, growth, access, convenience, rewards, security.
- Frame recommendations around the *benefit* to them, not the *feature* of the product.
- Prioritize honesty: only suggest things that truly match their situation and priorities.
- **Ask permission before suggesting something new**:  
  “Would you be open to hearing something that might help with that?”

### Key Questions to Ask Yourself (Silently)
- What problem could this product solve for them?
- What future stress could it prevent?
- What opportunity could it unlock for them?

### Phrasing to Transition Gently
- “Based on what you shared, something you might find helpful is…”
- “A lot of customers in a similar situation have found [product/service] makes a big difference because…”
- “Would it be helpful if I shared an option that could make this even easier for you?”

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Offering more than they asked for without connecting it to their needs.
- Overselling without verifying readiness.

### Personality-Specific Trust Cues

| Personality Type | Builds Receptiveness | Destroys It      |
|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Analytical       | Logic, comparisons   | Hype, emotion    |
| Relational       | Warmth, stories      | Being rushed     |
| Driven           | Outcomes, control    | Circular talk    |
| Cautious         | Reassurance, steps   | Pressure         |

### Mindset Reminder
*Think like a doctor, not a peddler. Prescribe thoughtfully, always linking back to their needs.*

## Pillar Three: Understanding What Someone’s Personality Is

**Objective:**  
Adapt your approach based on the customer's communication style, decision-making style, and emotional needs.

### Sub-Skills
- Notice if someone is logical, emotional, cautious, ambitious, skeptical, or trusting.
- Adjust your pacing: faster for confident decision-makers, slower for detail-oriented thinkers.
- Choose the right emotional language: excitement, reassurance, encouragement, caution.
- Build emotional connection by respecting their communication “style” (Transactional Analysis: Parent-Adult-Child can help here).
- **Observe trust signals** to adapt accordingly:
  - **Positive:** Leaning forward, relaxed posture, questions, small self-disclosures.
  - **Negative:** One-word replies, glancing at the time, sudden formality.

### Key Things to Observe
- Do they seem energized by details (rates, fees) or big-picture outcomes (goals, security)?
- Are they asking for control (ownership) or advice (guidance)?
- Are they moving toward a goal (achievement-driven) or away from risk (security-driven)?

### Quick Classifications

- **Task-Oriented**: Clear, factual, outcome-focused.
- **People-Oriented**: Warm, relational, connection-focused.
- **Process-Oriented**: Needs detailed steps, assurances.
- **Vision-Oriented**: Needs to see the big "why."

### Mindset Reminder
*Be water, not stone. Meet their personality where it is, not where you wish it were.*

## Optional Pillar Four: Creating and Sustaining Receptiveness

**Objective:**  
Maintain emotional openness throughout the conversation by attuning to readiness, trust signals, and communication styles.

### Core Behaviors
- Build safety before introducing new solutions.
- Calibrate pace and delivery based on trust signals.
- Always link back to their words and priorities to validate listening.
- Give them permission to say no or delay:
  > “Only if this feels like a fit—we can always revisit this later if it makes sense down the road.”

### Mindset Reminder
*Receptiveness is dynamic—earned moment by moment by being emotionally intelligent and observant.*
