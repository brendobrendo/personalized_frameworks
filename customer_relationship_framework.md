# Brendan’s Personal Banker Customer Relationship Framework

---

## Pillar One: Recognizing, Uncovering, and Understanding What Someone Wants

**Objective:**  
Discover both the *immediate* and *deeper* needs behind why the customer is in front of you today.

**Sub-Skills:**
- Listen actively to the customer's words *and* emotional tone.
- Use open-ended questions to draw out unstated needs.
- Interpret behaviors and statements using models like Maslow’s Hierarchy, Jobs-to-Be-Done, or the Five Whys.
- Identify the difference between surface requests ("I want to open a savings account") and deeper motivations ("I want to feel more secure about my future").

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "What’s most important to you about [topic]?"
- "What would success look like for you here?"
- "Can you tell me more about what led you to think about this today?"

**Mindset Reminder:**  
*Be a detective, not a salesperson. Follow their story, not your assumptions.*

## Pillar Two: Recognizing How Someone Could Benefit from the Products and Services You Offer (Even When They Don't Know It Yet)

**Objective:**  
Connect the customer’s deeper needs to meaningful, valuable solutions they may not even realize they need yet.

**Sub-Skills:**
- Translate needs into solutions, even when customers don’t explicitly ask.
- Think in categories: protection, growth, access, convenience, rewards, security.
- Frame recommendations around the *benefit* to them, not the *feature* of the product.
- Prioritize honesty: only suggest things that truly match their situation and priorities.

**Key Questions to Ask Yourself (silently):**
- "What problem could this product solve for them?"
- "What future stress could it prevent?"
- "What opportunity could it unlock for them?"

**Phrasing to Transition Gently:**
- "Based on what you shared, something you might find helpful is..."
- "A lot of customers in a similar situation have found [product/service] makes a big difference because..."
- "Would it be helpful if I shared an option that could make this even easier for you?"

**Mindset Reminder:**  
*Think like a doctor, not a peddler. Prescribe thoughtfully, always linking back to their needs.*

## Pillar Three: Understanding What Someone’s Personality Is

**Objective:**  
Adapt your approach based on the customer's communication style, decision-making style, and emotional needs.

**Sub-Skills:**
- Notice if someone is logical, emotional, cautious, ambitious, skeptical, or trusting.
- Adjust your pacing: faster for confident decision-makers, slower for detail-oriented thinkers.
- Choose the right emotional language: excitement, reassurance, encouragement, caution.
- Build emotional connection by respecting their communication "style" (Transactional Analysis: Parent-Adult-Child can help here).

**Key Things to Observe:**
- Do they seem energized by details (rates, fees) or big-picture outcomes (goals, security)?
- Are they asking for control (ownership) or advice (guidance)?
- Are they moving toward a goal (achievement-driven) or away from risk (security-driven)?

**Quick Classifications:**
- **Task-Oriented**: Clear, factual, outcome-focused.
- **People-Oriented**: Warm, relational, connection-focused.
- **Process-Oriented**: Needs detailed steps, assurances.
- **Vision-Oriented**: Needs to see the big "why."

**Mindset Reminder:**  
*Be water, not stone. Meet their personality where it is, not where you wish it were.*
