At its fundamental level, **multiplication is an abstraction of repeated addition**. When one multiplies two numbers, such as 4 × 3, the operation represents adding the number 4 to itself three times:  
4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

This is the foundational concept of multiplication. In early mathematics education, multiplication is introduced as a method to represent multiple groups of a given quantity. For example, 4 groups of 3 objects, or conversely, 3 groups of 4 objects.

However, the manner in which multiplication is taught in elementary school often emphasizes **memorization of times tables**. Students are encouraged to commit to memory that 3 × 4 = 12, typically without an explicit or sustained focus on the conceptual relationship to repeated addition. While this rote learning facilitates computational fluency, it sometimes diminishes a deeper understanding of what multiplication fundamentally represents.

As students progress to working with **larger numbers**, multiplication becomes an organized process of **adding partial products**. For instance, consider the example of multiplying 23 by 4:

- First, one computes 4 × 3 = 12.  
- Next, one computes 4 × 20 = 80.  
- The final step is to sum these partial products: 80 + 12 = 92.

This process is commonly formalized through **long multiplication**, where the digits are partitioned according to place value and each is multiplied separately before summing the results. For example:

Here, **92** is the result of aggregating 80 (4 multiplied by 20) and 12 (4 multiplied by 3). In essence, multiplication in this context is a structured series of additions of these scaled quantities.

When extending this approach to the multiplication of **multi-digit numbers**, such as 23 × 47, the procedure involves:

- Multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other.
- Summing all the resulting partial products.

Thus, multiplication—whether for single-digit or multi-digit numbers—can be understood as a **hierarchical application of addition**, where repeated addition operates at the core of the process.

**In summary:**
- Multiplication simplifies the process of adding the same number multiple times.
- Early pedagogical methods emphasize memorization for speed, while the underlying mechanics remain rooted in addition.
- Even advanced multiplication algorithms are built upon summing partial results derived from repeated addition.
