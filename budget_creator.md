# 🪙 30-Minute Budget Appointment Structure

## 1️⃣ Set Expectations (2 min)
“Thanks for meeting today. We’ll spend about 30 minutes building a simple budget you can actually use, focusing on where your money is going, what’s most important to you, and ways to make your goals easier to reach.”

---

## 2️⃣ Establish Their Goal/Pain Point (5 min)
Ask:
- “What’s prompting you to create a budget now?”
- “Is there something specific you’re hoping to accomplish—paying down debt, saving for something, or just knowing where your money is going?”

This helps them tie the exercise to a **meaningful motivator**.

---

## 3️⃣ Income Snapshot (5 min)
- “Let’s start with your monthly income after taxes.”
- Confirm pay frequency and amounts.
- If they have variable income, ask for a conservative average.

---

## 4️⃣ Identify and Categorize Expenses (10 min)
Using **high-level buckets**:
- Rent/mortgage
- Utilities
- Transportation (gas, insurance)
- Groceries
- Minimum debt payments
- Subscriptions
- Discretionary spending

Have them estimate amounts verbally; don’t get bogged down in perfect accuracy.

> “We can look at your statements together if you want a clearer picture next time.”

---

## 5️⃣ Analyze and Identify Opportunities (5 min)
Compare income vs. expenses and look for:
- Surplus to direct toward savings or debt
- Categories to reduce (e.g., subscriptions, dining out)
- Irregular expenses they haven’t considered

Ask:
> “Does anything here surprise you?”  
> “Where would you like to focus first?”

---

## 6️⃣ Create a Simple Action Plan (3 min)
Based on findings, agree on **one small step**, such as:
- Setting up a separate savings account for a goal
- Tracking dining out for 2 weeks
- Automating $50 to savings on payday

---

## 7️⃣ Close and Schedule Next Step (0-2 min)
- “Thanks for working through this today. Let’s check back in [2-4 weeks] to see how it’s going and adjust as needed.”
- Book a follow-up or invite them to reach out for deeper budgeting help or using digital tools.
