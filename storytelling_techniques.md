## Applying "Show, Don’t Tell" to a Historical Speech

When someone says “**show, don’t tell**” in the context of a speech, they mean:  
**Use vivid, specific examples and stories to illustrate your points, instead of just stating general facts.**

### Example:

**Instead of _telling_:**  
> “Great Barrington was shaped by industrialization, just like the rest of the country.”

**Try _showing_:**  
> “In the late 1800s, as textile mills roared to life across the Northeast, Great Barrington’s Main Street saw a new kind of hustle—factory whistles, clanging delivery carts, and train cars pulling into the Housatonic station loaded with raw materials and ambition. It was our town’s own reflection of a national transformation.”

### Practical Tips for "Show, Don’t Tell":

- **Use sensory details**  
  Describe what people might have seen, heard, or felt.

- **Include anecdotes**  
  For example, describe W.E.B. DuBois walking along the riverbanks as a child, observing the social inequalities he’d later write about.

- **Zoom in on moments**  
  Don’t just say "wealthy families moved in"—describe one of the Berkshire Cottages being built and how it contrasted with the working-class homes nearby.

- **Use dialogue or imagined inner thoughts**  
  When appropriate, this can humanize historical figures or townspeople and make your narrative more engaging.

Use these techniques to help your audience not just learn about Great Barrington—they’ll **feel** what it was like to live there during pivotal moments in American history.
