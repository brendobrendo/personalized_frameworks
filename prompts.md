Image Style Description Framework

- Medium & Era Reference:  
  What traditional or digital medium does the style resemble? Any particular art era (e.g., 1950s gouache, 1990s animation, etc.)?

- Color Palette & Texture:  
  Describe the dominant tones, saturation level, warmth/coolness, and whether the texture is smooth, grainy, or tactile.

- Mood & Emotional Effect:  
  What atmosphere does the style evoke? (e.g., nostalgic, surreal, whimsical, serene)

- Structure & Composition:  
  Comment on framing, balance, perspective, and visual hierarchy. Is it cluttered or minimalist? Geometric or organic?

- Comparative Touchstones:  
  Name any known illustrators, painters, or animation studios whose work this resembles.

- Brush & Texture Details (if applicable):  
  Describe visible brushstrokes, canvas/paper texture, or any digital replication techniques.

- Character vs. Background Styling:  
  Note differences between character design and background. Are characters more stylized or expressive? Does lighting or detail favor one over the other?

## Example Styles
### Soft Chronicle
Both visual softness and a storytelling mood.
```
A traditional painterly technique with a soft impressionistic touch, evoking the feel of mid-20th century gouache or acrylic illustrations. Brushwork is visible but controlled, lending a tactile texture to surfaces without becoming overly abstract. The color palette is muted yet warm, with a slight sepia or sun-washed filter that gives the piece a nostalgic, timeless quality. Lighting is naturalistic but diffused, emphasizing atmosphere over high contrast. Line work is subtly implied rather than overtly drawn, and the figures and forms maintain a stylized simplicity that borders on the cartoonish, while still respecting proportion and volume. The overall composition is balanced and narrative-driven, inviting emotional resonance through its softness and clarity.
