Image Style Description Framework

- Medium & Era Reference:  
  What traditional or digital medium does the style resemble? Any particular art era (e.g., 1950s gouache, 1990s animation, etc.)?

- Color Palette & Texture:  
  Describe the dominant tones, saturation level, warmth/coolness, and whether the texture is smooth, grainy, or tactile.

- Mood & Emotional Effect:  
  What atmosphere does the style evoke? (e.g., nostalgic, surreal, whimsical, serene)

- Structure & Composition:  
  Comment on framing, balance, perspective, and visual hierarchy. Is it cluttered or minimalist? Geometric or organic?

- Comparative Touchstones:  
  Name any known illustrators, painters, or animation studios whose work this resembles.

- Brush & Texture Details (if applicable):  
  Describe visible brushstrokes, canvas/paper texture, or any digital replication techniques.

- Character vs. Background Styling:  
  Note differences between character design and background. Are characters more stylized or expressive? Does lighting or detail favor one over the other?

## Example Styles
### Soft Chronicle
Both visual softness and a storytelling mood.
```
A traditional painterly technique with a soft impressionistic touch, evoking the feel of mid-20th century gouache or acrylic illustrations. Brushwork is visible but controlled, lending a tactile texture to surfaces without becoming overly abstract. The color palette is muted yet warm, with a slight sepia or sun-washed filter that gives the piece a nostalgic, timeless quality. Lighting is naturalistic but diffused, emphasizing atmosphere over high contrast. Line work is subtly implied rather than overtly drawn, and the figures and forms maintain a stylized simplicity that borders on the cartoonish, while still respecting proportion and volume. The overall composition is balanced and narrative-driven, inviting emotional resonance through its softness and clarity.
```

### Symmetric Minimal Futurism
Balanced structure meets editorial clarity in a tech-forward world.
```
A clean, digital illustration style influenced by mid-century modern design and contemporary editorial graphics. The composition is highly symmetrical, with characters and objects mirrored across a central axis to emphasize duality and contrast. Flat color fills and soft gradients replace texture and brushwork, lending a crisp, vector-like appearance that feels both polished and deliberate. The muted color palette leans warm and neutral, favoring subtle harmony over bold contrast. Lighting is soft and evenly distributed, with minimal shadowing used to suggest depth without realism. Characters are rendered in a stylized, geometric manner, more detailed than the understated background but still simplified and approachable. The overall tone is contemplative and quiet, evoking a gentle reflection on human-technology coexistence through a minimalist, structured lens.
```

### Storybook Realism
Evokes the feeling of an interesting and fun child-like story that blends realism and stylized figures.
```
Storybook Realism combines a softly textured, semi-realistic painting style for the background with cartoon-style characters in the foreground. The backgrounds should feature naturalistic brushwork—evocative of traditional landscape paintings—with soft lighting, subtle gradients, and atmospheric depth.

Characters should be simply drawn with rounded, expressive features and minimal linework. Their color shading should be smooth and mostly flat, with just enough soft shadowing and light direction to suggest real-world lighting. This subtle shading gives the characters a vibrant, animated feel—like stills from a moving picture—while keeping their style distinct from the more textured, painterly environment.

The overall effect should feel like a modern picture book illustration: grounded yet playful, serene yet full of life.
