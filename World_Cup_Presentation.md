## Suggestions for Developing the Skill of Understanding What People Want

1. **Practice Active Listening**: Focus on listening more than you speak during conversations.  
2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage others to share more about themselves by asking questions that can't be answered with a simple yes or no.  
3. **Empathize**: Put yourself in other people's shoes and consider their motivations and needs.  
4. **Reflect and Take Notes**: At the end of the day, jot down observations about what you learned from your interactions.

## 🎯 Three Actionable Goals for Today

### 1️⃣ Classify Three Customers’ Personality Styles
For **three customer interactions today**, identify:
- **Task-Oriented** (facts, outcomes)
- **People-Oriented** (warmth, stories)
- **Process-Oriented** (details, assurances)
- **Vision-Oriented** (big-picture, “why”)

✅ **Action:** Write down your classification in your notes to build pattern recognition.

---

### 2️⃣ Match Pace and Energy
Consciously **adjust your speed, tone, and phrasing**:
- Faster + direct ➔ Driven, task-oriented
- Slower + warm ➔ Relational
- Calm, step-by-step ➔ Cautious
- Big-picture ➔ Vision-oriented

✅ **Action:** Practice this **three times today** and note what feels natural or difficult.

---

### 3️⃣ Validate by Linking to Their Words
When explaining or recommending, **link your statements to something they said**:
- “You mentioned you want to feel more secure with your savings…” (Cautious)
- “Since you’re looking to simplify your finances…” (Task/Outcome)
- “You shared wanting to focus on your family right now…” (Relational)

✅ **Action:** Do this **once per customer conversation** to build precision listening.

## 🛠️ Supporting Silent Questions
- Are they energized by details or big-picture outcomes?
- Are they seeking guidance or wanting control?
- Are they moving toward a goal or away from risk?
