## Suggestions for Developing the Skill of Understanding What People Want

1. **Practice Active Listening**: Focus on listening more than you speak during conversations.  
2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage others to share more about themselves by asking questions that can't be answered with a simple yes or no.  
3. **Empathize**: Put yourself in other people's shoes and consider their motivations and needs.  
4. **Reflect and Take Notes**: At the end of the day, jot down observations about what you learned from your interactions.
