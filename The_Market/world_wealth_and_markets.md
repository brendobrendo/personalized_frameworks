## Global Wealth and GDP

As of early 2025, global household wealth is estimated to be approximately **$454.4 trillion**. This figure encompasses financial assets such as stocks and bonds, as well as non-financial assets like real estate, minus liabilities. With a global population of about **8.16 billion people**, this translates to an average wealth of around **$55,700 per person**.

The distribution of this wealth is highly uneven. According to the **UBS Global Wealth Report 2024**, the number of billionaires worldwide increased to **2,682**, collectively holding about **$14 trillion** in wealth. This concentration of wealth among a small fraction of the population highlights significant disparities in global wealth distribution.

Looking ahead, projections suggest that global wealth will continue to grow. The **Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2021** anticipated a **39% increase** in global wealth over five years, potentially reaching **$583 trillion by 2025**. This growth is expected to be driven by factors such as economic development in emerging markets and the accumulation of assets by the middle class.

**Intragovernmental holdings** refer to U.S. Treasury securities held by federal government accounts, such as trust funds for Social Security, Medicare, and military retirement. These accounts invest excess revenues in special-issue Treasury securities, representing internal borrowing within the government.

The term "trust fund" in the context of Social Security refers to a designated accounting mechanism within the U.S. government, not a separate legal entity like a private trust. While it suggests that payroll taxes are set aside for future benefits, the fund is managed by the Treasury and holds special-issue Treasury securities rather than real, segregated assets. Unlike private trusts that are legally separate and bound by fiduciary duties, federal trust funds are part of the government‚Äôs internal bookkeeping system. The name ‚Äútrust fund‚Äù is used to signal that revenues are earmarked for specific purposes, like Social Security, but in practice, it operates as an internal ledger within the broader federal budget.

- **Total Public Debt Outstanding**  
      The sum of **Debt Held by the Public** and **Intragovernmental Holdings**. It reflects the **total amount the federal government owes** across all creditors, including itself.
