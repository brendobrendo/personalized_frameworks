# How Trades Are Executed on a Stock Exchange Like the NYSE

## 1. Order Placement
- Investors place orders to buy or sell shares through a broker or trading platform. 
- These orders are sent to the exchange (e.g., NYSE).

## 2. Order Types
- **Market Orders:** Execute immediately at the best available price.
- **Limit Orders:** Execute only at a specified price or better.
- **Other Orders:** Includes stop-loss, stop-limit, and more complex order types.

## 3. Order Matching
- The NYSE uses a **central limit order book (CLOB)** where buy and sell orders are queued and matched.
- Matching follows **price-time priority**:
  - Highest bid is matched with the lowest ask.
  - Earlier orders at the same price get filled before later ones.

## 4. Execution
- Once a buy and sell order are matched, the trade is executed, and shares are exchanged between the buyer and seller.

## 5. The Role of Specialists (Designated Market Makers - DMMs)
- DMMs on the NYSE help maintain liquidity and a fair market.
- They provide quotes and step in to facilitate trading during imbalances.

# How Does the Market Decide Which Trades Get Executed?
- **Price Priority:** The best price available is filled first.
- **Time Priority:** Among same-price orders, the first one submitted is filled first.
- **Liquidity Factors:** When there are imbalances, prices adjust, or DMMs step in.

# Is the Price of That Stock Constantly Moving?
- **Yes**, stock prices update in real-time based on supply and demand.
- **Bid Price:** The highest price a buyer is willing to pay.
- **Ask Price:** The lowest price a seller is willing to accept.
- Market participants like high-frequency traders, retail traders, and institutional investors constantly influence price movements.

# How Do Other Instruments Like Options Affect These Transactions?

## 1. Hedging by Market Makers
- Selling options (e.g., calls) often leads to hedging with the underlying stock (**delta hedging**).
- Example: Heavy call option buying may lead market makers to buy the stock, putting upward pressure on the stock price.

## 2. Options Expiration Dynamics
- As expiration approaches, stocks may gravitate toward key strike prices due to "pinning" or hedge unwinding.

## 3. Implied Volatility Impact
- Active options trading can increase implied volatility, influencing sentiment and trading behavior in the stock itself.

## 4. Gamma Squeeze
- When prices approach certain strike prices, hedging adjustments by market makers can accelerate stock price movements (**gamma squeeze**).
