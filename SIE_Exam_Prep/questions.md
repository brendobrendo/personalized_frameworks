**Q: What’s the difference between a bank holding reserves at the Fed as cash versus as deposits?**
>A: The key difference between a bank holding reserves at the Fed in the form of cash versus deposits lies in accessibility and accounting. Reserves held as deposits at the Federal Reserve are electronic entries on the Fed’s balance sheet and can be used for interbank payments or to meet reserve requirements. In contrast, cash reserves typically refer to physical currency held in a bank’s vault, which is less liquid for large transactions and doesn’t earn interest. Both count as part of a bank’s total reserves, but only deposits at the Fed are commonly used for settling payments between banks.
