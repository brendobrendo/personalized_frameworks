# 📊 Daily Treasury Yield Curve Review Framework

---

## 🔁 Step 1: General Shape of the Yield Curve

1. **Is the yield curve normal (upward-sloping), flat, or inverted?**
   - What does this indicate about market expectations for economic growth and Fed policy?

2. **Which part of the curve is steepest?** (e.g., 2Y→10Y, 5Y→30Y)
   - Is the steepening happening at the short or long end?

---

## 🔁 Step 2: Changes Over Time

3. **Where are the largest moves in the past month (positive or negative)?**
   - Are these moves at the short, middle, or long end of the curve?

4. **Are short-term yields (3M–2Y) rising or falling?**
   - What does this say about expectations for **Fed policy**?

5. **Are long-term yields (10Y–30Y) rising or falling?**
   - Could this reflect **inflation fears, higher term premium, or long-term growth expectations**?

---

## 🔁 Step 3: Rate Direction Context

6. **Is the entire curve shifting up (rates rising) or down (rates falling)?**
   - A broad shift = repricing of **growth, inflation, or policy expectations**.

7. **Compare 10Y and 2Y yields:**
   - Is the spread widening or narrowing (steepening or flattening)?
   - What does this suggest about **recession risk**?
