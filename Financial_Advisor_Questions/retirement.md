# Retirement Advice, Guidance, and Questions #
## Qualifying for Benefits ##
- Social Security: People can start receiving SS benefits as early as age 62, but their monthly payment will be reduced; to get the full benefit, they need to wait until their full retirement age of 67 for those born in 1960 or later, with benefits increasing if delayed up to age 70. Elgibility also requires having worked and paid SS taxes for at least 10 years.
- Medicaid: 65 but qualifications are more stringent and more conditions.
- Withdrawing from retirement accounts without a penalty:
    - 401k: 59.5. Also Rule of 55 (if you quit or get fired in the year you turn 55 or later you can withdraw from your former employer's 401k).
    - Traditional IRA: 59.5
    - Roth IRA *Earnings*: 59.5 and have had the account open for at least 5 years. You can withdraw contributions at any time.

## Contributions ##
### 401ks ###
$24,500 for 50 and under. $32,500 (extra $8000 catch up) for 50-60. Limit of $35,750 for 60-63. All tax deductible. 401ks also typically have the benefit of an employer match.
### Traditional and Roth IRAs ###
Contribution limit up to $7,500 for under 50 and $8,600 for over 50. This is a combined limit for Traditional and Roth IRAs. Note that contributing to a 401k doesn't change the amount you can put into a Traditional IRA (the annual contribution limit is seperate), but it does affect whether your Traditional IRA contributions are tax deductible.
