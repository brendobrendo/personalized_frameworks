# Project Reframe: Pathways Progress Engine

## 🔁 New Project Framing

Instead of focusing on saving time as VPE, this project focuses on:

> Increasing member progress through Pathways while keeping weekly VPE workload between 0–15 minutes.

This shifts the leadership narrative from:
- “How do I reduce admin?”

To:
- “How do I create momentum and accountability for member growth?”

That’s a much stronger project.

---

## 🎯 Core Problem

Current situation:

- Members give non-Pathways speeches.
- Some complete projects but do not log them.
- The club misses education goals.
- Manual monitoring + nudging would increase VPE workload significantly.

This is not a scheduling problem.

It’s a **behavioral accountability problem.**

---

## 🧠 Project Mission

Build and pilot an AI-assisted system that:

1. Tracks member Pathways status
2. Identifies stalled progress
3. Sends personalized nudges
4. Encourages logging of completed projects
5. Keeps weekly VPE admin time ≤ 15 minutes

This combines:
- Behavioral design
- Light automation
- Leadership influence

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

Success will be measured by:

- Increase in Pathways speeches delivered  
- Increase in Pathways levels completed  
- Weekly VPE admin time between 0–15 minutes  

These are measurable and defensible.

## 🏗 Project Structure (2–3 Minute Plan Speech Framework)

### 1️⃣ The Problem (30–40 seconds)

“Our club has strong speakers, but many members are not progressing through Pathways, which impacts both their growth and our education goals.”

Highlight:
- Unlogged speeches
- Stalled members
- Missed credit toward club goals

---

### 2️⃣ The Opportunity (40 seconds)

“What if instead of manually chasing progress, we built an intelligent system that automatically monitors and encourages it?”

Reframe the VPE role as:
- Growth architect
- Momentum builder
- Accountability system designer

---

### 3️⃣ The Plan (60–75 seconds)

**Phase 1 – Audit**
- Determine how many members are stalled
- Define “stalled” (e.g., no logged progress in 60 days)

**Phase 2 – Build MVP**
- Create a simple tracking dashboard
- Define nudging logic
- Use AI to draft personalized outreach (human reviewed before sending)

**Phase 3 – Pilot**
- Test with subset of members
- Measure engagement and completion rates

---

### 4️⃣ The Team (30–40 seconds)

- **Caitlin** – Ensure ethical handling of member progress data  
- **Pratik** – Advise on workflow architecture and avoid overengineering  
- **Michael** – Represent member motivation and usability  
- **Kylie** – Keep scope realistic and timeline controlled

Quick Invite – Pathways Progress Initiative (Need Quick Reply)

Hi [Name],

For my “Manage Projects Successfully” Pathways assignment, I’m forming a small team to lead a real initiative in our club.

I want to build and pilot an automated system that helps increase member progress through Pathways — specifically by tracking stalled progress and intelligently nudging members to complete and log projects.

Our club has strong speakers, but many Pathways projects go uncompleted or unlogged. This affects both individual growth and our education goals.

Success would be measured by:

- Increase in Pathways speeches delivered  
- Increase in Pathways levels completed  
- Keeping my weekly VPE admin time under 15 minutes  

I’d value your involvement because of your strengths in [CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION].

This would likely involve:

- A short kickoff conversation  
- 1–2 strategic feedback check-ins  
- Reviewing specific pieces relevant to your expertise  

The project will run over the next [X weeks]. I need to finalize the team before tomorrow night’s project plan speech.

Would you be open to joining?

Thanks — I genuinely believe this could meaningfully improve member development in the club.

– Brendan

# Strategic Guardrails (Important)

⚠️ Avoid overbuilding.

Your MVP could simply be:

- A Google Sheet tracking progress  
- A rule: “No logged progress in 60 days = flagged”  
- AI-generated draft email  
- You review and send  

That alone could achieve your success metrics.

This project is about leverage, not infrastructure.

---

# Leadership Insight

The nudging must feel like encouragement, not policing.

Instead of:
> “Why haven’t you completed Pathways?”

Frame it as:
> “You’re close to Level 2 — want help getting that across the finish line?”

Motivation > enforcement.

---

# Reflection Angle (For the 5–7 Minute Speech Later)

This project will test:

- Scope control  
- Influencing without authority  
- Executing instead of endlessly iterating  
- Managing a team around a real deliverable  

This is founder muscle training inside a low-risk environment.

---

# Strategic Decision

Before moving forward, choose your primary objective:

- A) Behavioral nudging system  
- B) Transparent progress dashboard  
- C) Both — phased carefully  

Pick one primary focus for Phase 1. Avoid trying to optimize everything at once.
