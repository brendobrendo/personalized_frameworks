# Losing the Room  
## A Speech on Conflict Resolution

---

## Core Theme

Conflict resolution is not about overpowering, conceding, or arguing harder.  
It is about stepping back from ego, absorbing criticism, and designing a better solution.

---

## 1️⃣ Opening Scene – “I Lost the Room” (≈1 minute)

- Recently completed a web development bootcamp.
- Built a web app to automate Toastmasters role scheduling.
- Confident. Energized. Slightly self-righteous.
- Shared my screen on a Zoom officer meeting.
- Officers clicking around.
- Missing basic functionality.
- Silence.
- Blank stares.
- Lily’s eyes getting really wide.
- I noticed my voice rising.

**Line to land:**

> “That was the moment I realized… I had lost the room.”

Pause.

## 2️⃣ The Collision – Resistance & Ego (≈1–1.5 minutes)

Critical feedback from officers:

1. “Do we really want members logging into a new website every week?”
2. “What happens when you leave?”
3. “Are we creating long-term risk for short-term efficiency?”

Be honest:

- I was irritated.
- I didn’t think they were wrong.
- I thought they were behind.
- I came prepared to win.
- I had not come prepared to listen.
- I didn’t have the votes.
- The meeting felt tense.
- No one wanted to be there.

**Key Line:**

> “I had come prepared to win. I had not come prepared to listen.”

## 3️⃣ The Reset – Extracting Signal from Emotion (≈1 minute)

After the meeting:

- Frustrated.
- Needed distance.
- Slept on it.

Realization:

They weren’t resisting innovation.
They were protecting stability.

Original framing:

> “How do I get them to adopt my tool?”

New framing:

> “How do I solve their concerns?”

This is the turning point.

## 4️⃣ The Rebuild – Designing Around the Conflict (≈1.5–2 minutes)

Keep it simple (no deep technical explanation).

Step 1:
- Improve email generation using a Google Doc template.

Step 2:
- Dynamically insert role assignments from Google Sheets.

Step 3:
- Discover Google Apps Script.
- Automate everything behind the scenes.
- Generate emails automatically.
- Members still interact through email.
- If I leave, they revert to manual scheduling.
- No dependency risk.

**Thesis Line:**

> “Instead of trying to win the argument, I tried to outgrow the conflict.”

---

## 5️⃣ The Return – Green Light (≈1 minute)

Next officer meeting:

- Eye rolls.
- “Here he goes again.”
- But this time:
  - Same email experience.
  - Less work.
  - No fragility.
  - No behavioral change required.

Green light.

Not because I argued better.

Because I designed better.

## 6️⃣ Philosophical Closing – Build, Don’t Battle (≈1–1.5 minutes)

Reflection:

- I lead with conviction.
- I love my ideas.
- I believe innovation is the way forward.
- But conflict isn’t resolved with volume.
- It isn’t resolved with moral certainty.
- It isn’t resolved by who has more votes.

Conflict is resolved when someone asks:

> “What if there’s a third option?”

Broader pattern:

- In workplaces.
- In families.
- In society.
- We treat conflict like zero-sum.
- If one side wins, the other loses.

**Line:**

> “Zero-sum thinking is lazy thinking.”

Sharpen it:

> “The real breakthroughs don’t happen when we argue harder. They happen when we design something better.”

Avoid partisan framing.

Emphasize universality:

> “Innovation isn’t owned by the left or the right. It isn’t owned by one personality type or profession. It’s owned by whoever is willing to step back from ego, absorb the criticism, and build a solution that didn’t exist before.”

Personal evolution:

- Conflict resolution for me isn’t about conceding.
- It isn’t about overpowering.
- It’s about upgrading.

**Closing Options:**

Option A:
> “When I feel resistance now, I don’t ask, ‘How do I win?’ I ask, ‘What can I build that makes this argument irrelevant?’”

Option B (stronger):
> “The day I stopped trying to win arguments was the day I started resolving conflict.”
